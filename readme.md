# Personal Utilities

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of personal utilities that I find useful.

## Utility Scripts

### Compress-Video

Compresses a video file using the `ffmpeg` command-line tool. Usually reduces file size while preserving quality.

### Install-Fonts

Installs fonts recursively from the current directory using Windows' built-in tool.

### Install-Packages

Starts my package installer.

### Invoke-MAS

Invokes Microsoft Activation System in case of activation issues.

### New-NetFirewallRule-CurrentDirectory

Creates a new firewall rule blocking everything inside the current directory.

### Optimize-PSX

Finds compatible images and compresses them using the required chdman utility.

### Restart-Explorer

Self-explanatory. Stops explorer.exe forcefully and then starts it.

### Invoke-ReforgerInputs

Continually presses the "Enter" key inside Arma Reforger's window since no queueing feature currently exists.

Reforger doesn't have to be focused, so you can go about other business while waiting on a game.

### Set-FileAttribute

Sets the specified file attributes.

### Sync-GithubProfiles

Syncs currently loaded profiles with the repository maintained versions available in the profiles/ directory.

### Update-GitHubProfiles

Updates various local profiles by pulling changes from remote GitHub repositories.

### Update-M365

Invokes the Office C2R Client to upgrade M365 apps in case of issues.

### Update-Spicetify

Updates Spicetify to the latest version.
